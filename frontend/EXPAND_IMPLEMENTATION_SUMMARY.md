# Expand Button Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the expand button handler and updated the graph data flow to use the store's graph state in the HomePage component.

## File Modified
- `/Users/delusionalmakubex/Documents/projects/nasa-hack/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Import Updates
- Added `useEffect` to React imports for graph initialization logic
- Added `searchRelatedPapers` to API imports for expand functionality

### 2. Store Selectors
Added graph-related state and actions from Zustand store:
- `graphNodes` - Array of all graph nodes
- `graphLinks` - Array of all graph edges/links
- `setGraphData` - Initialize graph with nodes and links
- `addExpandedNodes` - Add new nodes from expansion with deduplication

### 3. Graph Data Flow Update
**Before**: Graph data was derived directly from `papers` array via transformation
**After**: Graph data is now sourced from the store's `graphNodes` and `graphLinks`

```typescript
// Old approach - direct transformation
const graphData = useMemo(() => {
  const transformed = transformPapersToGraph(papers);
  return transformed;
}, [papers]);

// New approach - read from store
const graphData = useMemo(() => {
  return { nodes: graphNodes, links: graphLinks };
}, [graphNodes, graphLinks]);
```

### 4. Graph Initialization
Added `useEffect` to populate store when search results arrive:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (papers.length > 0 && graphNodes.length === 0) {
    const transformed = transformPapersToGraph(papers);
    setGraphData(transformed.nodes, transformed.links);
  }
}, [papers, graphNodes.length, setGraphData]);
```

### 5. Expand Handler Implementation
Implemented comprehensive `handleExpand` function with:

**Conversation Context Support**:
- Checks if in chat mode and has chat history
- Converts chat history to "User: ... / Assistant: ..." format
- Passes context to API for context-aware expansion

**API Integration**:
- Calls `searchRelatedPapers` API with paper ID and optional conversation context
- Receives array of related papers from backend

**Graph Update**:
- Calls `addExpandedNodes` store action with source node, related papers, and context
- Store handles all deduplication logic and color assignment
- Graph automatically updates via reactive Zustand state

**Error Handling**:
- Try-catch around async API call
- Logs errors to console
- Note: User-facing error UI is optional for MVP

## Code Quality

### TypeScript
- Full TypeScript strict mode compliance
- No `any` types used
- Proper async/await for API calls

### Logging
- Comprehensive DEBUG level logging throughout the flow:
  - Expand button click
  - Conversation context detection
  - API call initiation
  - Response receipt
  - Graph update completion
  - Error conditions

### React Best Practices
- Proper dependency arrays for `useMemo` and `useEffect`
- No lint errors in HomePage.tsx
- Clean separation of concerns

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Flow
1. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. Perform a search to populate the graph
3. Click on a node to open the InfoPanel
4. Click the "Expand" button
5. Observe console logs for the expansion flow
6. Verify new nodes and edges appear in the graph with unique colors

### With Conversation Context
1. After selecting a node, click "Chat" button
2. Send a few chat messages about the paper
3. Click "Expand" button
4. Check console logs - should show "Using conversation context with X messages"
5. Backend should receive the conversation context in the request

### Error Scenarios
1. Backend not running - should log error and not crash
2. Invalid paper ID - should handle API error gracefully
3. Network issues - error logged to console

## Success Criteria (All Met)

✅ searchRelatedPapers imported from api.ts
✅ Store selectors added (graphNodes, graphLinks, setGraphData, addExpandedNodes)
✅ graphData useMemo updated to read from store
✅ useEffect added to initialize graph from search results
✅ handleExpand implemented with conversation context support
✅ Error handling included with try-catch
✅ Comprehensive logging throughout the flow
✅ useEffect imported from React
✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
✅ No lint errors introduced in HomePage.tsx

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add loading state for expand button while API call is in progress
- Add user-facing error messages (toast notifications)
- Add visual feedback when new nodes are added
- Add animation for camera to focus on newly added nodes
