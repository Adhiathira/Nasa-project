## Browser Testing Checklist

### Standalone Test (http://localhost:5173/test-info-panel)

- [ ] Page loads without console errors
- [ ] Panel is visible on load (isOpen=true by default)
- [ ] Toggle button shows "Close Panel"
- [ ] Click toggle button - panel slides out smoothly
- [ ] Toggle button shows "Open Panel"
- [ ] Click toggle button - panel slides in smoothly
- [ ] Close button (X) works correctly
- [ ] Panel slides out when X is clicked
- [ ] Frosted glass effect is visible
- [ ] Text is readable (white on dark)
- [ ] Paper count shows blue accent color
- [ ] Animation is smooth (300ms)

### Integration Test (after integrating into HomePage)

- [ ] Search for papers (e.g., "quantum computing")
- [ ] Panel slides in when graph appears
- [ ] Search query displays correctly with quotes
- [ ] Paper count matches number of results
- [ ] Paper count uses correct singular/plural form
- [ ] Close button (X) closes panel
- [ ] Panel slides out smoothly when closed
- [ ] Reset button still works (z-index 20 > 10)
- [ ] Panel is above graph but below reset button
- [ ] New search: panel stays closed until reopened

### Visual/UX Checks

- [ ] Panel width is appropriate (400px)
- [ ] Full viewport height coverage
- [ ] Smooth slide animation (no jank)
- [ ] Backdrop blur effect works
- [ ] Border is visible and subtle
- [ ] Close button hover effect works
- [ ] Text contrast is good
- [ ] Layout doesn't shift during animation
- [ ] No layout overflow issues

### Accessibility Checks

- [ ] Close button has aria-label
- [ ] Panel has role="complementary"
- [ ] Panel has aria-label
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab to close button)
- [ ] Enter/Space activates close button
- [ ] Screen reader announces panel content

### Responsive Behavior

- [ ] Panel maintains 400px width
- [ ] Panel doesn't interfere with graph interactions
- [ ] Z-index hierarchy is correct
- [ ] Animation performs well (30+ FPS)

### Browser Console Checks

- [ ] No React warnings
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No missing import errors
- [ ] No CSS/styling warnings
- [ ] No accessibility warnings

## Performance Checks

- [ ] Animation is GPU accelerated (transform/translate)
- [ ] No layout reflows during animation
- [ ] Component renders quickly (<16ms)
- [ ] No memory leaks when opening/closing repeatedly
- [ ] State updates don't cause unnecessary re-renders

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Empty search query: "" displays correctly
- [ ] Zero papers: "0 research papers" (plural)
- [ ] One paper: "1 research paper" (singular)
- [ ] Large paper count: "999 research papers" fits
- [ ] Very long search query: text wraps with `break-words`
- [ ] Rapid open/close: animation handles properly

## Integration Requirements

To integrate into HomePage, verify:
- [ ] Import statement added
- [ ] State variable for `isInfoPanelOpen` created
- [ ] `searchQuery` destructured from Zustand store
- [ ] `useEffect` to auto-open panel on search complete
- [ ] InfoPanel component added to graph view JSX
- [ ] Close handler updates state correctly
- [ ] Reset handler closes panel

## Known Limitations

- Panel is desktop-only (matches project requirements)
- No mobile/tablet support (per project spec)
- No keyboard shortcuts to open/close (future enhancement)
- State managed locally, not in Zustand (design choice)

## Troubleshooting

**Panel doesn't slide in**:
- Check `isOpen` prop is true
- Verify TailwindCSS is loaded
- Check browser console for errors

**Frosted glass not visible**:
- Verify backdrop-blur-xl support in browser
- Check browser supports CSS backdrop-filter
- Try Chrome/Edge/Safari latest versions

**Animation is choppy**:
- Check browser performance
- Verify GPU acceleration is working
- Look for other heavy JS processes

**Text not visible**:
- Check text-white classes applied
- Verify background opacity is not 100%
- Check z-index stacking

## Sign-Off

- [ ] Component created and tested standalone
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Integration guide reviewed
- [ ] Ready for production use
